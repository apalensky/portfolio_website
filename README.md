# Recent projects


## Project 1:  National Lacrosse League box scores
  **Tools:** `Python (Jupyter)` `R (Rstudio)` `Markdown`
  
  **Technical skills:** `Web Scraping` `Data Wrangling`
  
* Made all National Lacrosse League (NLL) box score data publicly available for the first time to enable independent access and analysis.
* Scraped and cleaned all publicly available box scores from 1993 through 2020, totaling nearly 55,000 records for floor players and nearly 6,000 records for goalies.
* Applied sorts based on season and added nontraditional performance metrics per game, per 60 minutes of play, as ratios, and as percentages where applicable.
* This project is ongoing, with data files downloadable from this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/apalensky/nll-statistics). I will continue to add insights, applications, and images to this project so that others can learn more about box lacrosse trends.

## Project 2: Similarity scoring college pitchers
 **Tools:** `R (Rstudio)` `RShiny` `SQL` `Trackman`
 
 **Technical skills:** `Data Wrangling` `Similarity Learning` `Technical Writing`
 
* Imported and transformed over 150,000 plate appearance events.
* Generated novel pitch similarity scoring using R and Euclidean Distance.
* Applied pitch usage weighting with Earth Mover's Distance to score arsenals.
* Built a Shiny application for staff to use the model in offseason pitch design.

## Project 3: Product recommendation engine
 **Tools:** `R (Rstudio)` `Rattle GUI` `PowerPoint`
 
 **Technical skills:** `Data Wrangling` `Association Rule Mining` `Data Visualization` `Technical Consulting`
 
* Consulting project for a beverage distribution company covering 1,500 products, close to 2,500 customers, and more than 8250,000 transactions over the past four years.
* Removed sparse records and top nationally selling brands from analysis to focus on marketing new and niche products, broken down by beverage category.
* Captured insights from association rule mining to construct a recommendation engine which returned the top desired number of uncarried products sold at similar businesses or identified as emergent trends in the beverage industry .
* Presented the company with the recommendation engine and a report covering commonly recomended products and how these recommendations varied by customer business category and size.

## Project 4: National Park invasive fish species
 **Tools:** `R (Rstudio)` `PowerPoint`
  
 **Technical skills:** `Web Scraping` `Data Wrangling` `Data Visualization`
 
* Imported nearly 120,000 known NationalPark wildlife species from the [National Park Service Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity) and reduced data to to extant fish species.
* Scraped additional National Park data from online as well as known fish species non-endemic to each state from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
* Cleaned and joined our scraped data to perform feature exploration.
* Choropleth mapped invasive fish species as a percentage of all fish species prevalent in states with National Parks.
* Gave a presentation to undergraduate departmental professors on wildlife resource management effectiveness using research on states identified with high invasive ratios.
